Election Audit Summary:

Our script would work for any number of candidates as long as there are at least 2 candidates. We can also use any number of counties for larger scale elections. We could modify our code to take data about a polling location. We could also modify our code to get the demographics of each voter that votes and give exact percentages based on those specifc demographics. 


Thank you!
